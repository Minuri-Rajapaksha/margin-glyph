To build and test the InfoClassifier solution

Build the solution.

Run the project by pressing F5. A second instance of Visual Studio starts.

Make sure that the indicator margin is showing. (On the Tools menu, click Options. On the Text Editor page, make sure that Indicator margin is selected.)

Open a code file that has comments. Add the word "info" to one of the comment sections.

A light green circle with a dark green outline appears in the indicator margin to the left of the code window.
